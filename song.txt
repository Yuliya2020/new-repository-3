She says that the world is a broken mess
It's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time

And no, I cannot fix it
No, I cannot make it stop
So I said...

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live in real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live in real life, real life?

Prays on her knees since the towers' fall
To a god she does not know
She's beggin' him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs blow (Ooh)
She says, "How could I, oh, ever believe
In somethin' that would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say
'Cause I think I lost my faith
But I thank you for the day
Oh, everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it
And I cannot make it stop
So I said...

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live in real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live in real life, real life?

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
The only thing that's real to me is
You

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live in real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live in real life, real life? Oh hey
(Real life, hey)
Real life, real life, oh hey
Real life, real life, oh hey
